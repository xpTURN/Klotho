# Changelog

## [0.1.3] - 2026-04-30

- IMP-35: 3-layer defense against malformed wire packets — L1 `MessageSerializer.Deserialize` try/catch + cache invalidation (overflow-safe boundary check), L3 `Room.DrainInboundQueue` try/finally (guaranteed buffer recovery + loop continuation), L2 server `_pendingPeers` atomicity + immediate disconnect on malformed/unknown payload (pending and regular dispatch). Minimal `ZLogWarning` traceability at 3 client-side wire-input sites.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-04-30

- IMP-32: `LiteNetLibTransport` connection key — constructor injection with `DefaultConnectionKey` constant fallback.
- IMP-33: Propagate disconnect reason via `INetworkTransport.OnDisconnected` — added 6-value `DisconnectReason` enum; `Listen`/`Connect` now return `bool` to surface startup failures immediately. Client handlers gate auto-reconnect to `NetworkFailure`/`ReconnectRequested` only.
- IMP-34: 64-bit `SessionMagic` with CSPRNG generation + device-binding on cold-start reconnect.
- Aligned spectator transport connection key with the main transport.
- Aligned `Connect` API deviceId with the provider pattern; added send-site logging.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-04-29

- IMP-30: Unified Engine `_playerCount` semantics — roster source-of-truth consolidated to `_activePlayerIds.Count`. Replaced `OnPlayerCountChanged` with `OnPlayerJoinedNotification`.
- IMP-31: Split Spectator RoomRouter capacity gate — separated into two layers: an absolute upper bound (DoS protection, `MaxPlayersPerRoom + MaxSpectatorsPerRoom`) and the spectator slot gate (`HandleSpectatorJoin`), resolving the regression where spectators were blocked once 4 players filled the room.
- Added `SessionConfig.MaxSpectators` + wired into `BrawlerDedicatedServer` single-room and multi-room paths (including expanded Listen capacity). Removed the `maxPlayers` CLI argument.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-26

- First release
